🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


📊 Titanic Dataset Analysis

Data Analyst Internship Project


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights using statistical summaries and visual exploration techniques.

The objective is to identify patterns, relationships, trends, and anomalies that influenced passenger survival.


🎯 Objective

Understand dataset structure

Perform statistical exploration

Visualize data distributions

Identify relationships between variables

Summarize key findings


🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📘 Pandas

📊 Matplotlib

🎨 Seaborn

📓 Jupyter Notebook


📂 Dataset Information

Dataset: Titanic Dataset

Rows: 891 passengers

Features include:

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Sex

Age

Fare

Survival Status

Embarked Port


🔎 EDA Steps Performed


1️⃣ Data Understanding

Used .info() to inspect structure

Used .describe() for statistical summary

Checked missing values

Analyzed categorical distributions


2️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Age Distribution (Histogram)

Fare Distribution (Boxplot for outliers)

Survival count analysis


3️⃣ Bivariate Analysis

Survival vs Gender

Survival vs Passenger Class

Age vs Fare (Scatterplot)


4️⃣ Multivariate Analysis

Correlation Heatmap

Pairplot visualization


📊 Key Insights & Findings

✔ Females had significantly higher survival rates than males

✔ 1st Class passengers had higher survival probability

✔ Higher fare passengers were more likely to survive

✔ Age had moderate influence on survival

✔ Fare shows presence of extreme outliers


📈 Correlation Insights

Survival negatively correlated with Pclass

Survival positively correlated with Fare

Strong relationship between Fare and Passenger Class


📌 Conclusion

The analysis clearly indicates that gender and passenger class were the most influential factors affecting survival on the Titanic.

EDA helped in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships that would be essential for further predictive modeling.
